For additional context, here is the original eval idea:

Based on the earlier conversation roughly how much would it cost to assess 10k applications. Each applicant would be assessed against the criteria they have set out. They may run numerous assessments.  We would also need a way to bulk export or deliver the results with Reasoning back to them (might be the 10k or they might just want the 600 qualified candidates.
Here are the other factors they take into consideration further in the process. I'm not sure if we could potentially "score" for any of these but they are listed below.

Application of Knowledge: Demonstrating understanding and application of aviation knowledge.
Application of Procedures and Compliance with Regulations: Following established procedures and regulations.
Communication: Effectively conveying and receiving information.
Aeroplane Flight Path Management, automation: Managing the aircraft's flight path using automation systems.
Aeroplane Flight Path Management, manual control: Managing the aircraft's flight path using manual control inputs.
Leadership and Teamwork: Effectively leading and collaborating within a team.
Problem Solving and Decision Making: Identifying and resolving problems and making sound decisions.
Situation Awareness and Management of Information: Maintaining a clear understanding of the situation and managing relevant information.
